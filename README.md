mirror-achd-air-quality-reports
===============================

Mirror Allegheny County air quality reports.  ACHD updates this report periodically,
but only makes the most recent report available on its website.  mirror-achd.py is intended to be run
from crontab, and double-checks that the most recent report has actually changed prior to writing to the mirror.

Mirrored reports are available at http://data.cmucreatelab.org/allegheny-county-health-district-air-quality-report-mirror/
